## Implementation

Source code for the experiments described in this article is available for
download. The code runs on Matlab 2014. The dataset used for evaluation is a
subset of [medleydb](http://medleydb.weebly.com/). The code includes a json file with the index of the subset,
you still need to obtain a copy of the dataset from the original authors.
